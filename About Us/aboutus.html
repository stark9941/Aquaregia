        <article>Aquaregia is an annual inter-college cultural fest of one of  Rajasthan's biggest science institutes, <p class="highlighted-text">"University Maharaja College"</p> , which has its roots back in 2016. It all began in 2013 when a group of enthusiastic students from our college decided that there should be more to college life than just textbooks. They formed a Cultural team that participated in various national-level events.

A year passed, and the team had grown from 3 to 100+ members, participating in 10 distinct level events in Dance, Drama, Quiz, Debate, and several others.
